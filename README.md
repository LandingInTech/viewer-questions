# Dashboard and Frontend For Displaying Viewers Questions

While making the first episode it was clear that viewers would like to participate on the talk and ask questions to the guest of the day.

I've decided to create a very basic dashboard that I could trigger questions to be displayed on the Stream. To achieve that this project needs to be run and use `localhost:3000` as a source in OBS.

## Run the project in dev mode

You can run this project in development mode by running the command `yarn dev`
